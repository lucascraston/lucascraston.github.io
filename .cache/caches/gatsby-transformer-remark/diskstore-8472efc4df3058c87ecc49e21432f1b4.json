I studied computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa. I was also part of the first ever <a href=\"https://devdegree.ca/\">Dev Degree cohort</a>, during which I gained experience in everything from data science, to cloud security. I am currently working as a full time developer at Shopify working on integrating hardware with the Shopify point of sale React Native application . I plan to use this blog as a way to document useful information I come across in my professional and person life. You can expect to see everything from mobile development tricks to organization hacks and everything in between.</p>"}
